            <h4>Chicken Confit</h4>
            <p>a French dish where chicken legs are slowly cooked in their own fat until tender and flavorful.

The result is incredibly moist, flavorful, and tender meat with a crispy skin when finished in the oven. Chicken confit can be served with roasted vegetables, potatoes, or a fresh salad.</p>

            <h4>lamb shank navarin</h4>
            <p>A classic French stew made with lamb shanks and a variety of spring vegetables. The dish gets its name from "navet," the French word for turnip, which is a key ingredient. The lamb shanks are browned and then slow-cooked in a rich broth of wine, stock, tomatoes, and aromatics such as garlic and herbs. The stew also includes vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and peas. The slow cooking process makes the lamb tender and infuses the dish with deep, savory flavors. Lamb Shank Navarin is typically served with crusty bread or over a bed of mashed potatoes or rice.</p>
