            <h2>Risotto</h2>
            <p>A classic Italian dish known for its creamy texture and rich flavor. It is made by slowly cooking Arborio or Carnaroli rice in broth, typically with onions, garlic, and white wine. The rice is stirred frequently, allowing it to release its starch and create a creamy consistency without the addition of cream. Common variations include adding ingredients such as mushrooms, seafood, vegetables, or saffron. Risotto is often finished with grated Parmesan cheese and a pat of butter, enhancing its richness and depth of flavor. It is a versatile dish that can be served as a main course or a side dish.</p>

        <h3>Preparing :</h3>
        <div class="Preparing1">
            
            <ul>
                <li> Prepare the Broth:</li>
                    <p>Warm the chicken or vegetable broth in a saucepan over low heat. Keep it warm throughout the cooking process.</p>
                <li>Sauté the Onion:</li>
                    <p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat.</p>
                    <p>Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</p>
                <li>Toast the Rice:</li>
                    <p>Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir to coat each grain with the oil and butter mixture.</p>
                    <p>Toast the rice for about 1-2 minutes until it becomes slightly translucent at the edges.</p>
                <li>Deglaze with Wine (Optional):</li>
                    <p>Pour in the white wine, if using, and stir constantly until the wine is absorbed by the rice.</p>
                <li>Add Broth, Simmer, and Stir:</li>
                    <p>Add a ladleful (about 1/2 cup) of warm broth to the rice.</p>
                    <p>Stir continuously until the broth is mostly absorbed. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer.</p>
                <li>Continue Adding Broth:</li>
                    <p>Continue adding the warm broth, one ladleful at a time, stirring frequently.</p>
                    <p>Allow each addition of broth to be absorbed before adding more. This process helps release the starch from the rice, creating a creamy texture.</p>
                <li>Cook Until Creamy and Tender:</li>
                    <p>Cook the risotto for about 18-20 minutes in total, or until the rice is creamy and tender with a slight bite (al dente).</p>
                <li>Finish the Risotto:</li>
                    <p>Remove the pot from the heat.</p>
                    <p>Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter and grated Parmesan cheese until melted and well combined.</p>
                    <p>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
            </ul>
