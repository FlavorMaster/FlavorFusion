            <h2>Seafood Gnocchi</h2>
            <p>gnocchi is a luxurious Italian dish that combines tender potato dumplings (gnocchi) with a variety of seafood, typically in a creamy sauce. The gnocchi, made from mashed potatoes and flour, provide a soft and pillowy base that complements the delicate flavors of shrimp, scallops, crab meat, or other seafood choices. The dish is often enhanced with a rich and velvety cream sauce, infused with garlic, Parmesan cheese, and fresh herbs like parsley. Seafood gnocchi is celebrated for its harmonious blend of textures and flavors, offering a satisfying and elegant dining experience reminiscent of coastal Italian cuisine.</p>

            <h4>Preparing the Gnocchi:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Prepare the Potatoes:</li>
                    <p> Pierce the potatoes with a fork and bake them in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 45-60 minutes, or boil them in water until tender. Let them cool slightly.</p>
                <li> Make the Gnocchi Dough:</li>
                    <p>Once cooled, peel the potatoes and either pass them through a potato ricer or mash them until smooth.</p>
                    <p>Spread the mashed potatoes on a clean surface or in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add the beaten egg and salt.</p>
                <li>Form the Dough:</li>
                    <p>Gradually add the flour, mixing with your hands, until the dough comes together and is soft but not sticky. Be careful not to overwork the dough.</p>
                <li>Shape the Gnocchi:</li>
                    <p>On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into smaller portions.</p>
                    <p>Roll each portion into a long rope about 1/2 inch thick.</p>
                    <p>Cut the rope into bite-sized pieces, about 1 inch long. You can use a knife or a bench scraper for this.</p>
                <li>Cook the Gnocchi:</li>
                    <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</p>
                    <p>Carefully drop the gnocchi into the boiling water in batches. Cook until they float to the surface, about 2-3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a plate or tray.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="preparing2">
            <h4>Making the Seafood and Sauce:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cook the Seafood</li>
                    <p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the mixed seafood and cook until just done, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the seafood from the skillet and set aside.</p>
                <li>Make the Sauce:</li>    
                    <p>In the same skillet, add the white wine and cook for 2-3 minutes until reduced by half. Add the fish or vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in the heavy cream and Parmesan cheese, cooking until the sauce thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.</p>
                <li>Add the Tomatoes:</li>
                    <p>Stir in the cherry tomatoes and cook until they soften, about 2-3 minutes. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
                <li>Combine with Seafood:</li>
                    <p>Return the cooked seafood to the skillet and mix gently to combine.</p>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="Assembling">
            <h4>Combine and Serve</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the Gnocchi:</li>
                    <p>Add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet with the seafood sauce. Toss gently to coat the gnocchi in the sauce.</p>
                <li>Garnish and Serve</li>
                    <p>Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately. Enjoy your homemade seafood gnocchi!</p>
            </ul>
        </div>

    </div>
     
    <div class="Tips">  
        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use starchy potatoes like Russets or Yukon Golds. They have less moisture and will yield lighter gnocchi.</li>
            <li>After boiling, let the potatoes cool and dry out a bit before mashing. This helps prevent the dough from becoming too sticky.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough just until it comes together. Overworking the dough can make the gnocchi tough.</li>
        </ul>
