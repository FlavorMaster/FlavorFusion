            <h2>French Onion Soup</h2>
            <p>A classic French dish made with caramelized onions, beef broth, white wine, and a hint of thyme. The soup is simmered until rich and flavorful, then traditionally served in bowls topped with toasted baguette slices and melted Gruyère or Swiss cheese. The cheese is broiled until bubbly and golden brown, creating a deliciously gooey topping that pairs perfectly with the savory, sweet onions. This comforting soup is often enjoyed as a starter or a main course, especially during colder months.</p>

            <hr>
            
            <ul>
                <li>6 large yellow onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
                <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 baguette, sliced</li>
                <li>2 cups grated Gruyère or Swiss cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="For2">
            
            <ul>
                <li>Caramelize the Onions:</li>
                    <p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat.</p>
                    <p>Add the thinly sliced onions and stir to coat them in the butter and oil.</p>
                    <p>Cook the onions, stirring frequently, until they turn a deep golden brown and caramelize. This process can take about 30-40 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Sprinkle the onions with salt and sugar after the first 10 minutes of cooking to help with the caramelization.</p>

            <h4>Cooking</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add Garlic and Deglaze:</li>
                    <p>Once the onions are deeply caramelized, add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</p>
                    <p>Pour in the white wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Simmer until the wine is reduced by half.</p>
                <li>Add Broth and Herbs:</li>
                    <p>Add the beef broth, chicken broth, bay leaves, and thyme to the pot.</p>
                    <p>Bring the soup to a simmer and let it cook for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</p>
                    <p>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the bay leaves before serving.</p>
                <li>Prepare the Bread:</li>
                    <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</p>
                    <p>Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet and bake for about 10 minutes, or until the bread is toasted and golden brown.</p>
                <li>Assemble the Soup:</li>
                    <p>Preheat the broiler in your oven.</p>
                    <p>Ladle the hot soup into oven-safe bowls or crocks.</p>
                    <p>Place one or two toasted baguette slices on top of each bowl of soup.</p>
                    <p>Sprinkle a generous amount of grated Gruyère or Swiss cheese over the bread and soup.</p>
                <li>Broil to Melt the Cheese:</li>
                    <p>Place the bowls under the broiler for about 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and begins to brown.</p>
                    <p>Carefully remove the bowls from the oven and serve the soup immediately, making sure to warn your guests that the bowls are hot.</p>
